    <h1>🥐 Croissant</h1>
    <p>
      A croissant is a buttery, flaky, Austrian viennoiserie pastry inspired by
      the shape of the Austrian kipferl but using the French yeast-leavened
      laminated dough.[1][better source needed] Croissants are named for their
      historical crescent shape, the dough is layered with butter, rolled and
      folded several times in succession, then rolled into a thin sheet, in a
      technique called laminating. The process results in a layered, flaky
      texture, similar to a puff pastry.
